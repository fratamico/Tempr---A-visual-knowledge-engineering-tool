The main site is in index.html.

The preprocessing file contains all files used for preprocessing and all csv filesthat were used for the visualizations. All python files in this folder were authoed by me.

The other html files at the root level are ones that I have modified, as discussed in the paper, to produce the visualizations.

The files in the js and css directories are libraries.
